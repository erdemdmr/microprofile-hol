= Implementing Microservices with MicroProfile Hands-on-Lab

In this workshop you will learn about the MicroProfile programming model for developing microservice applications. 
Although MicroProfile is currently based on Java EE technologies, the expectation is that this will evolve to using the corresponding Jakarta EE technologies.

We will go through the APIs and implementations for:

* Externalized Configuration
* Fault Tolerance
* Health Checks
* Application Metrics
* Security
* Open API
* Open Tracing
* Client API

You will learn how to run you applications in available implmentations from different vendors.
